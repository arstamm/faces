# FACES (inspired by Chelsea)

## Overview

As a teenager, my sister Chelsea came up with a unique art form for drawing faces.
This project is intended to bring that artform to life. FACES incorperates turtle
from tkinter to showcase this art digitally.

You can select various scenes using argv from the commandline.
The commandline documentation goes as follows:

```{}
main.py scene
```

Scene Options: scene_one, scene_two, scene_three

## What I learned

In this project, I learned how to tilt and scale complex shapes.
I also learned how to use and set command line parameters as well.
